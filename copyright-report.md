TASK 1: Platform Copyright Analysis:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does the platform detect copyrighted content?
Youtube uses a combination of manual and automated copyright detection systems. The first option is for manual removal 
requests which can be submitted by the content’s rights holders. There is an online webform where rightsholders can 
quickly submit their request details and youtube will then remove the content to see if it legally can be removed 
from the site. Through the webform, rights holders can also request that copies of the removed content are 
automatically filtered and prevented from being reuploaded. YouTube’s second copyright detection tool, the “Match 
Tool” combines automated and manual efforts. The Match Tool automatically notifies creators when videos that are the 
same or similar are uploaded and provides the original creator with the option to move forward with requesting the 
removal of the copied material. Youtube’s third and final copyright protection tool is the fully automated Copyright 
ID. With this tool, creators and rights holders with complex needs can create pre-defined settings for how YouTube 
should respond when copied content is uploaded. Some options for how Copyright ID can respond include blocking videos 
from being viewed, monetizing the video with ads running against it, or tracking the contents viewership statistics.

What happens when content is flagged as potentially infringing?
When content is flagged by Content ID, the rightsholder is able to decide whether to block the video from being 
viewed, monetize the video and receive the revenue personally, or track the video and retrieve the viewer statistics. 
The uploader will then receive a copyright claim notice in their YouTube studio and will be informed of what portion 
of their content was matched by the automated system as well as any restrictions on their account such as posting 
restrictions or changes in monetization status. If the content is manually flagged and a removal request is processed,
 the video is removed, the uploader will receive a copyright strike and for each strike there are certain penalties 
that can eventually result in the channel being terminated. 

What is the appeals or counter notification process?
In order to dispute a copyright claim, the uploader must either 1) have all needed rights to the video content, 
2) use the content in a way that appeals to fair use, 3) believe the video was misidentified by the system. Once a 
dispute is submitted the person that placed the copyright claim has 30 days to respond to the dispute. The claimant 
can then choose to let the claim expire - resulting in it being dropped, create a copyright removal request - which 
if accepted will result in the deletion of the content from youtube, release the claim, or reinstate it. If 
reinstated the claim can then either be accepted or appealed by the uploader. If appealed, the claim will either be 
released or the content will be set for removal.

How does the platform handle monetization of content containing copyrighted material?
Videos can be monetized during a copyright dispute if both the uploader and the claimant want it to be monetized. If 
a claim is disputed within 5 days, the monetization funds starting on the day the claim was placed are held. If a 
dispute is filed more than 65 days after the claim has been issued, the funds are held starting on the day of the 
dispute's issuance. (the process is the same for appeals.) All revenue data on copyright claimed content is hidden 
from the uploaders' statistical dashboards.

Are there any special programs?
The YouTube Content ID program is a special program as it is restricted to approved rightsholders rather than all 
creators. The program allows the copyright owners to upload reference files and set the aforementioned enforcement 
rules that determine how detected content is treated.

TASK 2: Fair Use Experiments:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9r191X9J24&t=56s

1st Uploaded Content: “Paternity Court Short” 
Content Notes:
 - 19 seconds of the beginning of the video.
 - Uploaded at 11:23 PM.
 - Passed instant copyright checks. No known consequences or flagging within 1st 12 hours of upload. 

2nd Uploaded Content: “Paternity Court Medium” 
 - Content Notes:
 - 51 seconds of the beginning of the video.
 - Uploaded at 11:33 PM.
 - *YouTube Copyright Status: Instantly failed copyright checks. I was shown a page to view details of the claim and 
   another page where I could only take action by crreating a dispute. (See screenshots.)

*To Avoid Potential copyright Infringements as an aspiring content creator, I deleted the flagged content after being 
offered the opportunity to dispute the claim.**

TASK 3: AI Generated Content Investigation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ai Tool Used: Suno (Music Generation) & ChatGPT (Lyrics Generation)

1st Uploaded Content: “Falling for You - SZA Inspired Song About Falling In Love"

Content Notes:
Suno Prompt: “Please create a song about falling in love with inspiration from SZAs CTRL album.”
No imagery in the video, just a black screen with text of the title. The post had no mention of the inspiring artist's 
name.
Uploaded at 12:16 AM
YouTube Copyright Status: Passed instant copyright checks . No known consequences or flagging within 1st 12 hours of 
upload. 

2nd Uploaded Content: “Almost Yours - SZA Love Galore Parody”

Content Notes:
ChatGPT Prompt: “Write an original parody-style song inspired by the themes and vibe of “Love Galore”
Suno Prompt: *Uploaded ChatGPT generated lyrics
No imagery in the video, just a black screen with text of the title. The post had no mention of the inspiring artist's 
name.
Uploaded at 12:18 AM
YouTube Copyright Status: Passed instant copyright checks. No known consequences or flagging within 1st 12 hours of 
upload. 

3rd Uploaded Content: “SZA Love Galore Redone” 
Content Notes:
Suno Prompt: *Uploaded SZA Original Love Galore Lyrics
Suno Refused to regenerate because of inappropriate content and copyright concerns and the concept was never completed

Research Findings:
Through this experiment I discovered that many AI tools have built in copyright protections to prevent the theft or 
generation of copyrighted material. When requesting altered lyrics from ChatGPT the application actively rejected the 
request and gave me alternative prompt ideas to get my desired outcome without potentially violating copyright laws. 
Additionally, Suno would not regenerate a song using copyrighted lyrics. Therefore, AI does appear to hack checks and 
balances built in to ensure that its outcomes are transformative rather than directly copying existing works. 
Additionally,  discovered that the generations made by AI pass all copyright checks which directly correlates with 
the court precedent of AI media being considered transformative and therefore not a copyyright violation.

TASK 4: Legal Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAIR USE FACTORS ANALYSIS:

First Uploaded Content: “Paternity Court Short”
1) Purpose and character of the use (transformative? commercial?)
   - The “Paternity Court Short” video featured a direct copy of a segment of copyrighted content and did not add any 
     additional commentary or transformation to the original work. There was also no educational or critical 
     intention with the reupload of the piece. Considering the upload as non-commercial does not directly correspond 
     to fair use. 
   - Against Fair Use Factor 1

2) Nature of the copyrighted work (creative vs. factual?)
   - The original work was a televised court show and featured creative rather than factual or informational content. 
     Creative works are typically more protected under this standard when copied.
   - Against Fair Use Factor 2

3) Amount and substantiality used
   - Considering the length of the content uploaded to youtube (19 seconds) compared to the length of the original 
     content (45+ minutes) there is very minimal content usage.
   - Favors Fair Use Factor 3

4) Effect on the market for the original
   - The potential market harm on the original work is minimal as the 19 seconds only show the introduction to the 
     complete episode and a few moments of the episode’s content. Another viewer would need to watch the original 
     video to complete the episode or watch enough to be satisfied/grasp the show concept.
   - Favors Fair Use Factor 4

Overall Analysis:
The video did pass YouTube’s copyright standards but could have a 50/50 chance of being flagged for takedown 
considering it goes against 2/4 of the Fair Use principles.

Second Uploaded Content: “Paternity Court Medium” 
1) Purpose and character of the use (transformative? commercial?)
   - The “Paternity Court Medium” clip was slightly longer at 51 seconds and again directly copied the original 
     content without any modification, transformation, critiques, or educational purposes/enhancements.
   - Against Fair Use Factor 1

2) Nature of the copyrighted work (creative vs. factual?)
   - The same as the 1st uploaded content. The video is a creative work and thus receives more protection.
   - Against Fair Use Factor 2

3) Amount and substantiality used
   - Considering the length of the content uploaded to youtube was 51 seconds this is still very minimal usage when 
     compared to the length of the original content at 45+ minutes. However, the content does show far more of the 
     case and provides enough information and context of the episode for it to be considered “substantially used.”
   - Against Fair Use Factor 3

4) Effect on the market for the original
   - Considering that the piece does show a decent amount of the episode and provides the complete context of the 
     episode in the introduction and court case overview, it is more likely for this longer clip to replace the 
     original. Knowing the case details could potentially deter users from wanting to outsource the original 
     especially given the title of the original work is not provided.
   - Against Fair Use Factor 4

Overall Analysis:
The video violates 4/4 of the fair use principles which aligns with it being instantly removed by Google's Content ID.

CASE LAW RELEVANCE:
The results of the fair use and AI copyright experiments directly correlate to the outcomes of Google v Oracle (2021) 
and Sega v Accolade (1992). In Google v Oracle it was determined that copying protected works can be considered fair 
use when the copying is transformative and serves a new purpose that does not replace the original in the  market. 
Considering how the “transformative” concept has been applied to A enabling content made from copyrighted works to be 
fair use, the results of the AI experiment and the lack of copyright flags from YouTube are logical. In Sega v 
Accolade it was determined that copying is permissible when it allows new creative expression or functionality which 
would correlate to why AI passed the various checks YouTube conducts but copied clips fail.

GAP ANALYSIS:
Fair use is a legal doctrine that is typically evaluated by courts when disputes arise. The way YouTube enforces 
copyright is primarily through automated pattern matching and predetermined rightsholder preferences, not individual 
legal reviews. Therefore, content that may be legally infringing has the potential to remain online (e.g. “Paternty 
Court Short”), while content that could plausibly qualify as fair use may still be monetized or restricted by the 
automated tools.
